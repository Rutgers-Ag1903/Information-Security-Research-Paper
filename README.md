### Abstract:  
The move to cloud computing represents a pivotal change in how organizations secure and manage their data in the modern digital environment. This paper considers the advantages of adopting Amazon Web Services (AWS), both from a security perspective and from an economic standpoint, compared with the more traditional on‑premises infrastructure that many companies still maintain. We begin by outlining the Shared Responsibility Model, which clarifies how accountability for security is divided between AWS and its customers. The discussion then turns to several of AWS’s integrated tools—such as Identity and Access Management (IAM), GuardDuty, and automated compliance services—and explains how they support a more adaptive and preventative security posture than is typically achievable in on‑premises systems. Economic factors are equally important; AWS's pay-as-you-go model allows businesses to gain advanced security features that may have been impractical or costly without having to make those large upfront capital expenditures. When taken as a whole, these elements imply that a well-planned AWS deployment not only improves an organization's security posture but also results in significant cost savings, freeing up resources for long-term strategic objectives and innovation.
